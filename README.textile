This plugin makes your "Textpattern CMS":http://www.textpattern.com database more flat, manageable and editable. Edit templates, forms, pages, preferences, variables and sections as flat files. Use any editor, work in teams and store your website's source under your favorite "version control system":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control.

*Warning: this plugin will permanently remove your current templates when a valid path will be saved under the plugin prefs.*

h2(#requirements). Plugin requirements

rah_flat’s minimum requirements:

* Textpattern 4.5+

h2(#installation). Installation

# Paste the content of the plugin file under the *Admin > Plugins*, upload it and install;
# Visit the *Admin>Preferences* tab to fill the plugin prefs.

h2(#prefs). Preferences / options

* *Path to the templates directory* - Specifies path to the root templates directory containing all the content-type specific directories. This path is relative to your 'textpattern' installation directory. For example, a path @../themes/my_theme@ would point to a directory located in the same directory as your _textpattern_ directory and the main _index.php_ file.
* *Security key for the public callback* - Security key for the public callback hook URL. Importing is done when the URL is accessed. The URL follows the format of:
* *Production status for the systematic upload* - The site production status for which you want to activate the systematic templates upload (see "Basics":#basics).

bc. http://example.com/?rah_flat_key={yourKey}

Where @http://example.com/@ is your site's URL, and @{yourKey}@ is the security key you specified.

h2(#basics). Basics

Your flat files are imported to the database:

* Automatically on the background when the site is in the production status selected in the related plugin preference.
* When the public callback hook URL is accessed. The URL can be used for deployment.

1. Variables are imported only once to avoid the override of user strings. To update them, remove or rename .json files and refresh.

If you want to exclude a certain content type from importing, just don't create a directory for it. No directory, and rah_flat will leave the database alone when it comes to that content type.

h3. About variables

This plugin allow to set variables via flat files by setting custom preferences.
These prefs are visible by default under the _Preferences_ tab to allow users to set or change their value but you can also hide some of them (see "here":#variables) if they don't need to be override. Custom preferences are then injected by the plugin to be used as Txp variables like so: @<txp:variable name="my-variable"/>@ where _my-variable_ is the name of the related .json file.

h2(#structure). Structure

* my-folder
** sections
*** my-section.json
** pages
**** my-page.txp
** forms
*** article
**** my-article-form.txp
*** comment
**** my-comment-form.txp
*** category
**** …
*** section
*** link
*** file
*** misc
*** custom
** prefs
*** sitename.json
** variables
*** my-variable.json
** styles
*** my-styles.css

*Warning: while forms are now organised by types, they all still need to have different names.*

h2(#examples). File examples

h3(#sections). Sections

Here is an example of content for an @about.json@ file.

bc.. {
    "title": "About",
    "page": "default",
    "css": "default",
    "is_default": false,
    "in_rss": false,
    "on_frontpage": false,
    "searchable": true,
    "description": "Informations about this website."
}

p. where:

* @"title": "…"@ - The title of the section.
* @"page": "…"@ - The name of the section.
* @"css": "…"@ - The stylesheet used by the section.
* @"is_default": "…"@ - ?
* @"in_rss": "…"@ - Whether to display section articles in the feeds or not.
* @"on_frontpage": "…"@ - Whether to display section articles on the front page or not.
* @"searchable": "…"@ - Use false to exclude section articles of the search results.
* @"description": "…"@ - The description of the section.

h3(#preferences). Preferences

The plugin has set of preferences you can find on Textpattern's normal preferences panel.
Here is an example of content for a @sitename.json@ file.

bc.. {
    "value": "My website"
}

p. where:

* @"value": "…"@ - The value of the preference.

h3(#variables). Variables (through custom prefs)

Here is an example of content for a @menu_sections.json@ file.

bc.. {
    "value": "articles, about, contact",
    "type": "PREF_HIDDEN",
    "event": "rah_flat_var",
    "html": "text_input",
    "position": "10",
    "is_private": true
}

p. where each data is optional and the default values are the following:

* @"value": "…"@ - _default: '' (empty)_ - The default value of the preference.
* @"type": "…"@ - _default: PREF_PLUGIN (for Txp 4.6, else PREF_ADVANCED)_ - To hide a pref in the _Preferences_ tab, use _PREF_HIDDEN_, you should probably not use _PREF_CORE_.
* "event": "…" - _default: 'rah_flat_var'_ - The prefs group name where you want to display your custom pref.
* @"html": "…"@ - _default: 'text_input'_ - To display radio buttons, use _onoffradio_ or _yesnoradio_.
* @"position": "…"@ - _default: 0_ - Use position to sort your prefs.
* @"is_private": "…"@ - _default: false_ - If _true_, the pref will be user related.

p. While you can call your custom preference as a Txp variable like so: @<txp:variable name="menu_sections" />@; they will be prefixed with @rah_flat_var_@ under the preferences tab and you will need to use the textpack as below to add user friendly titles.

h3(#textpacks). Textpacks

Here is an example of content for a @en-gb.json@ file.

bc.. {
    "admin": {
        "rah_flat_var_menu_sections": "Sections used in the menu"
    },
    "common": {
    },
    "public": {
        "public_side_text_item": "A public side text item",
        "another_text_item": "Another public side text item"
    }
}

p. Text strings are only updated if they already exist, otherwise, they can be inserted, updated or removed.
